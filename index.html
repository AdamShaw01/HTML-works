                Male ducks and female ducks have a few small differences, depending on their species. There's one difference that speaks for itself, of course - male ducks are one of the few bird species that have a penis, rather than a cloaca. This is a fact that came to prominence online as male mallards and other ducks actually have a penis shaped like a corkscrew.

                The other noticeable difference between male and female species of domestic ducks and international ducks is that the male of the species is typically more vibrantly coloured. For example, male ducks in parks typically have brown feathers across their main body, as well as black tailfeathers, green iridescent feathers on their heads, and yellow bills. This is counterposed by the female ducks, which have brown feathers across their whole body, and brown bills.
                There are also some behavioural differences between male and female ducks, though these can most prominently be seen during mating season.

                During nesting, male ducks are generally more aggressive than female ducks, and will fight off other male ducks to spend some time with ducks they perceive as 'theirs'.

                Furthermore, male ducks will engage in a courtship ritual where they duck their head from one side to another repeatedly. This is totally male courtship behaviour.
